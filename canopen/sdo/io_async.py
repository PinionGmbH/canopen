    """The abstract base class for all I/O classes, acting on streams of
    bytes. There is no public constructor.

    This class provides dummy implementations for many methods that
    derived classes can override selectively; the default implementations
    represent a file that cannot be read, written or seeked.

    Even though IOBase does not declare read or write because
    their signatures will vary, implementations and clients should
    consider those methods part of the interface. Also, implementations
    may raise UnsupportedOperation when operations they do not support are
    called.

    The basic type used for binary data read from or written to a file is
    bytes. Other bytes-like objects are accepted as method arguments too.
    Text I/O classes work with str data.

    Note that calling any method (even inquiries) on a closed stream is
    undefined. Implementations may raise OSError in this case.

    IOBase (and its subclasses) support the iterator protocol, meaning
    that an IOBase object can be iterated over yielding the lines in a
    stream.

    IOBase also supports the :keyword:`with` statement. In this example,
    fp is closed after the suite of the with statement is complete:

    with open('spam.txt', 'r') as fp:
        fp.write('Spam and eggs!')
